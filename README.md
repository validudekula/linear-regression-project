They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting car pricing in the American market, as they may differ from the Chinese market. 

The company wants to know the following things:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car?
How well do those variables describe the price of a car?
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the American market.

The management will use be using this model to understand exactly how the prices vary with the independent variables. Accordingly, they can change the design of the cars, the business strategy, etc., to meet certain price levels.
